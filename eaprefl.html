			<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When thinking about lecturers here in Ireland and in my native country I notice many differences as well as some similarities.</p>
			
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I am from Russia, so, obviously, most teachers are not native English speakers there and some have not ever been in English-speaking countries, which is an important aspect for me, as I want to progress into Trinity College, where I would need a very good level of the language. Therefore I need as much experience of learning in English as I can get. Another thing that comes to mind is that lecturers here in the IFP go into much detail when explaining a new topic and they make sure every single student understands all concepts, whereas most teachers in Russia usually just explain a topic and then give a bunch of homework on it. And, lastly, I feel much closer to the staff of the IFP than to my previous teachers, although I have only been here in Dublin for around 2 weeks. In my opinion this is because of their welcoming and friendly personalities, which makes them much more approachable.
			Despite these differences, I can still see some similarities. For example, lecturers both in the IFP and in my school are very interested in the subject they are teaching and make their best effort to develop that excitement in their students. </p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, I can say that there are some other subtle differences, but I think I outlined most of them in this text.</p>
