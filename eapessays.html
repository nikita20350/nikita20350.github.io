Eating organic products has numerous health benefits because of higher vitamin content and no chemicals used. Another plus of doing this is the impact we have on the environment: it promotes sustainable farming and minimizes the carbon footprint.</span></p><p><span class="c5"></span></p><p><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless it is clear why many people choose not to do it. Buying from farmers directly is usually more expensive and saving money is a priority for many. Also if a big portion of supermarkets&rsquo; customers decided to spend their money elsewhere, the quality of products in shops would go down along with the cost and the salary of the workers.</span></p><p><span class="c5"></span></p><p><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I would support this initiative, because I prioritize my health when shopping for groceries. So around 70% of my total spendings on food a year might go directly to farmers.</span></p>
